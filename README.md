# IntPyGMT
IntPyGMT is an open-source Jupyter Notebook library that generates interactive maps from png images where you can click to retrieve map coordinates. It supports two primary functionalities:

#### 1. From a GMT/PyGMT-generated png

Creates an interactive map from a GMT/PyGMT-generated png image. This feature supports all GMT/PyGMT projection systems provided that the correct xshift and yshift parameters are specified.

This works by overlaying an interactive matplotlib widget on top of a GMT/PyGMT-generated png. User's click coordinates are recorded and adjusted for the map's border width (via xshift and yshift) before processed through GMT's mapproject module which returns map coordinates based on the specified region and projection. 

The easiest way to control the border width of a GMT map is to first create an empty background canvas that **must be** larger than the main map. Then, you can adjust the xshift and yshift by shifting the main map relative to the background canvas. Please see `demo_conical` and `demo_pygmt` for demonstrations.

#### 2. From a _borderless_ png map (in Mercator projection)

Creates an interactive map from a _borderless_ png image **in Mercator projection**. This is not limited to GMT/PyGMT-generated outputs provided that the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the map are known.

This works by aligning a matplotlib map on top of a _borderless_ png image. User's click coordinates on the matplotlib map are then directly registered and returned as map coordinates. Please see `demo_borderless_mercator_png` and `demo_borderless_mercator_pygmt` for demonstrations.  For an example of this function adapted and applied to an InSAR time-series plot, see `demo_time_series`.

### Installation
This code works in conjunction with PyGMT (see https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html).
A simple way to initialize PyGMT environment:
```
conda create --name pygmt --channel conda-forge pygmt
conda activate pygmt
```
Then, apart from cloning, you can install the library using pip:
```
pip install IntPyGMT@git+https://github.com/chelle0425/IntPyGMT.git
```

### Usage
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure that matplotlib widget is enabled before you call the function.
> ```
> %matplotlib widget
> ```


To use on top of a GMT/PyGMT-generated png (see `demo_conical/cascadia.ipynb`):

```
from IntPyGMT.IntPyGMT_overlay import gmt_png
%matplotlib widget

region=[-136, -118.5, 38.5, 53.1]
projection="B-127.25/45.8/43.19/47.86/11c"

gmt_png("cascadia.png", region, projection, "2c", "5c")
```


To use on top of a _borderless_ png map (see `demo_borderless_mercator_png/Herat_InSAR_stc.ipynb`):
```
from IntPyGMT.IntPyGMT_overlay import mercator_png
%matplotlib widget

llcrnrlon=62 # lower left corner longitude 
llcrnrlat=32.65 # lower left corner latitude
urcrnrlon=72.8 # upper right corner longitude
urcrnrlat=38.65 # upper right corner latitude
grid_freq = 2
mercator_png("Herat_InSAR_stc.png", llcrnrlat, urcrnrlat, llcrnrlon, urcrnrlon, grid_freq)
```

### Acknowledgements
This project was initiated as part of my 3rd-year Independent Project in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London (see: [MomentTensorSum](https://github.com/chelle0425/MomentTensorSum)). It has greatly benefitted from subsequent development during my time as a COMET research intern at the University of Leeds.

I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to Dr Milan Lazecky, for it was his invaluable guidance and unwavering support that made this project a reality. 

Additionally, I am grateful to COMET, the UKâ€™s Centre for the Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics, for funding my research internship. It was during this time that we developed the core functionality of the code.
